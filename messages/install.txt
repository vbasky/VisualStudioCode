# Visual Studio Colour Scheme

Thanks for checking out this theme, based on the syntax highlighting found in the official Visual Studio Code theme. I hope you enjoy using it!

I've done my best to cover what I consider to be the common syntaxes for PHP, HTML/Blade, JavaScript, CSS/SASS/LESS, Python, YML and Markdown.

If you have any suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
